# supervised-learning-regression

The main objective of this workshop is to practice two concepts of regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, by working with data from several datasets. The tools that will be used are Python, Pandas, Sklearn, and matplotlib.

<b> Simple linear regression  </b> is a statistical method that models the relationship between two variables, with one variable considered as the independent variable and the other as the dependent variable. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be described by a straight line.

 <b> Multiple linear regression </b> , on the other hand, models the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be described by a linear equation with multiple variables.
